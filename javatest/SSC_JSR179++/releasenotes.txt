Description:
====================

The SiRFStudio JSR179++ library for J2ME enables application development for device based on J2ME(MIDP 2.0 and CLDC1.1). This library is available in two versions as:

- JSR82 compliance, Support Bluetooth discovery.
- JSR82 incompliance.

JSR179++ library is compliance to standard JSR179 specification.


Features:
=========
 - Location with criteria (in asynchronous and synchronous methods)
 - NMEA sentences
 - Proximity Notifier
 - GPS Satellite updates
 - Configuration APIs (AGPS server IP and Port, Serial connection string)
 - Debug logs 


This folder includes all key component needed for application development using JSR179++.

1) Both BT and Non-Bt version of JSR179++ library named as SiRFstudio.jar.
2) SiRFstudio sample application that demonstrates some of the features of  
JSR179.
3) Sample application source code for the reference to the user of JSR179++  
APIs.
4) SiRFstudio JSR179++ API documentation (in HTML format).
5) Standard JSR179 API documentation (in HTML format).

Build Overview
=============

Basic Requirements:

- Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.3


Creating JSR179++ sample application project (Bluetooth Version).


- Launch WTK KToolbar; Select the "Sun java WTK -> KToolbar" program item.

- Select the "File ->New project" menu item from the KToolbar. New project dialog will appears.

- Enter project and midlet class name.Midlet name should be "SiRFstudioDemo" for SiRFstudio sample application and project name can be any.

-Click OK

- “Setting for project” screen appears.

- Select the API selection tab and than select CLDC1.1 and Bluetooth Obex (when Bluetooth version of JSR179++ library) from the configuration and Additional API section.

-Click OK


- Now the project directory  has been created with the project name under the WTK directory.

- Open the project directory and copy the SiRFstudio.jar into the lib directory and copy the sample source code into the SRC folder.



Building the SiRFstudio Sample Application(Bluetooth Version)

- select the “Project ->Build” menu item. Alternatively, you may select the Build icon from the KToolbar screen. When the build completes, the project build status is shown on the Ktoolbar screen.


- Select Run icon or alternatively select the “Project ->Run” menu item to run the application on the WTK simulator.

Creating jar file for target device 

- Select the “Project ->package->Create package" menu item.
- It will create the jar file into the bin directory of the project.
