MIDP: Location API Example - Tourist Route
---------------------------

This MIDP application demonstrates the usage of the Location API by showing
the current device coordinates. The MIDlet also shows how to store the current
coordinates associated with location information to the device's landmark store.

The Location API is supported from S60 3rd Edition and Series 40 3rd Edition
(some devices) onwards.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- The MIDlet contains features such as compass (orientation) that are not currently 
supported by Nokia devices. Such features are not visible in the MIDlet at 
run time unless a device supports them.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

There are three main views in the application:

"Route View" - The application will show this after a successful startup.
            From this view the user can monitor the current device coordinates
            and switch to the Landmark Editor view.

"Landmark Editor" - This view enables the user to store the current coordinates
            associated with user-defined location information to the device's
            landmark store. From this view the user can switch back to the Route View
            or to the Landmark List.

"Landmark List" - This view lists all landmarks stored with this application.
            The user can either remove the selected landmark or update its
            information. The update command will switch the user to the Landmark Editor view.

In addition, the MIDlet contains two views ("Compass View" and "Pitch and Roll View")
that are shown only if the device or emulator supports orientation.


The following are quick instructions on how to run the example from command line
and from Eclipse IDE:

1) Running the MIDlet from command line: 
----------------------------------------
The MIDlet can be run in Prototype SDK 3.0 / 4.0 from the command line:

[Prototype SDK install path]\bin\emulator.exe -Xdescriptor:[workspace path]\TouristRoute\TouristRoute.jad

2) Running the MIDlet from Eclipse IDE:
--------------------------------------
- Import the TouristRoute project into your Eclipse workspace.
- Open the TouristRoute project in the Package Explorer.
- Create a run configuration:
	1. Right-click TouristRoute.jad
	2. Select "Run As | Run..."
	3. Select Nokia SDK Plug-in from the Configurations and click the new button.
	4. Select the SDK (e.g., Prototype_4_0_S60_MIDP_Emulator)
	5. Click the run button. 

On the next runs you can reuse the existing run configuration. For more detailed
instructions, see the SDK's User's Guide.

BUILD & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Configuring Eclipse and Carbide.j 1.0
-------------------------------------
The preferred method is to use Eclipse with Carbide.j 1.0 installed
as a plug-in. Choose "File | Import | Existing Project into Workspace" from
the top menu of Eclipse and browse to the TouristRoute folder. This will add
the project to your Workspace.

You may need to configure the Build Path in "Project | Properties |
Java Build Path | Libraries" to point to the right location of Nokia 
Prototype SDK 4.0. In addition, ensure that Carbide.j 1.0 is configured
to use Prototype SDK 3.0 / 4.0 from the "Emulators | Configure Emulator..." 
menu.


Compiling using Ant
-------------------
A build.xml file is included that uses the ANT tasks included
in Carbide.j 1.0. It may be necessary to modify the location of 
Carbide.j and the desired emulator/device from the build.xml file.

For instructions on how to configure build.xml, see
Carbide.j 1.0 User's Guide and Apache Ant 1.6.5 Manual.
